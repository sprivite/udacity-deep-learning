Here I build generative adversarial networks (GANs) to construct fake images of faces using the CelebA dataset. Using relative simple architectures for both the discriminator and generators, I find interesting results after only about 25 training epochs. The results here are interesting, but do not come close to the state of the art. An interesting discussion of recent GAN results can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10337.pdf.
