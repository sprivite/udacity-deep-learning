# Introduction

In this project, I used an LSTM-based architecture and nine seasons of
Seinfeld scripts to generate synthetic Seinfeld TV scripts. This is a
cute little project that demonstrates how to build and train an LSTM
but it's hardly something to take serious. Although the generated
scripts do contain some of the flavor of the Seinfeld characters'
speech, the overall content is borderline gibberish. A lot of really
obvious flaws appear, like George entering a room he is already in, or
speakers replying to themselves. The LSTM understands the statistics
of the symbols it is processing, but not the meaning.
